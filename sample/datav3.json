Being gone until after my Alcatraz tour at ~8pm my total for the parking was $30, which is really cheap for being probably the safest place to park.\n\nThis place is about 10 minutes from Chinatown, and 15-20 minutes from the pier. However, there’s a few bike rentals north 10 minutes from here that are great for exploring the entire city in an afternoon. I would definitely recommend this parking place!!!",

              "text": "I am extremely frustrated with my recent experience at the SF Parking North Beach garage. The lack of clarity in their parking ticket policy, combined with poor customer service, has left me feeling both angry and disappointed.\n\nThe signs clearly state that the ticket should be kept with you, but this policy should be changed to indicate that it should be left in the car. This setup seems designed to trick people into losing their tickets, forcing them to pay the full price without any prior warning or clear explanation.\n\nDuring peak parking hours on a weekday (around 3:30 PM), I had to quickly pull over to find a spot as I needed to use the bathroom before continuing my drive. I am not familiar with the area, and after parking, I realized I had misplaced my ticket. I called the number listed on the garage window, hoping for assistance, but the person who answered was incredibly rude. I apologized for the mistake, but before I could explain, the staff member abruptly interrupted me, shaming me for losing the ticket and stating that I would have to pay the full price.\n\nIf there is no staff on-site, it would make sense for them to have access to a system where they can verify entry times and charge the correct amount based on that. Unfortunately, the representative did not offer any assistance or show any interest in resolving the issue. It felt as though the garage company was more concerned with penalizing customers than providing service.\n\nI eventually located my ticket after retracing my steps to find a public bathroom. This could have been avoided if the garage had on-site staff or better customer support systems. Needless to say, I quickly paid the correct amount for my $4 parking and left the garage, determined not to return.\n\nOverall, I am extremely dissatisfied with the experience and would not recommend this garage to others. The lack of proper signage, combined with poor customer service, makes this facility a frustrating and unreliable option for parking in the area.",

But there are lot of signs to not leave important/valuable items or viewable bags in your car.\n\nEntering was easy as leaving. It is a busy parking lot so you may need to make sure to save some time to find parking spots. We got extremely lucky and found a parking spot on the first floor. It is very tight, so if you're planning on driving a bigger SUV or Truck, expect it to be very difficult to maneuver through.\n\nTicket: keep your ticket with you. Do not leave it in the car. When you are leaving, pay at the pay station before leaving or you can pay at the gate. We paid before leaving and it was easy. Just insert the paid ticket and the gate opens.\n\nOverall, a solid parking spot for this location. There is an elevator that will lead you straight into the mall as well.",

It didn't feel sketchy inside, and on the weekends it feels busy (people coming and going). However we're aware of the \"don't leave anything inside policy\". We were concerned, so we left literally nothing inside, and we had no issues. Also we parked with the back (trunk) to the driving part of the parking garage to make it harder for anyone to hide while doing something. And we parked near a light. We found parking available the day we arrived (Thursday), but noticed a line of cars to enter on Saturday around lunch time, so beware availability during the weekend. Paying is simple enough, just pricey. We looked at many reviews of different parking garages to find the safest one and I believe they are all the same really, just don't leave anything at all (we also lowered our backseats to show the empty inside of the trunk). Apparently there's a similar structure on top of a police station a bit more north but we couldn't be bothered to go that far.",

DO NOT PARK HERE!!!!\n\nWe were going through San Francisco to get to our hotel in Oakland on the last day of our vacation. My children wanted to see China town so I figured I would park in a \"secured\" parking garage. WHAT A JOKE!\n\nWe walk around Chinatown for about an hour and a half just to come back to our van smashed to pieces! 4 windows broken out by thieves. Luckily enough we were smart enough to still take purses and wallets but they still got some of our luggage and worse of all they took all of my children's souvenirs and my wifes quilt blanket that she has had for 30+ years that she slept with every night!!!\n\nOnce I discovered our vehicle broken into I immediately ran around looking for someone to talk to because the police said \"fill out an online report\". I found an attendant on the 4th floor and he had the audacity to tell me we were asking for it because we left luggage in there!! WE PARKED IN A PAID SECURE PARKING GARAGE!\n\nWhen it was all said and done in my opinion the attendants are in on this. They see vehicles come in on the first floor near the exit with valuables and reach out to the other thieves. They come in the garage with a vehicle smash the windows and grab your stuff. This is not your typical smash and grab this is an organized operation. If you park here it's not a matter of if you will be broken into its a matter of when!\n\nUpdate: when we arrived home a very nice san francisco police officer reached out to me and had found some of our stuff laying in a pile on side of road. We are getting some souvenirs and other things back. WE WERE LUCKY!! If you park here you may not be so lucky. Hopefully you are smarter then me and read these reviews!!!!",

The garage is conveniently located within walking distance of many hotels and conference venues, and the daily maximum rate of $44 is reasonable.\nI was a little nervous at first because there is no on-site personnel, but I was happy to see that there was increased police patrol during the conference. I had no problems at all, and my car was safe and sound when I returned the next morning.\nIf you're looking for a convenient place to park your car overnight in San Francisco, I recommend the Ellis-O'Farrell Garage.

The facility would be better served  unmanned. The employee proved to be the worst interaction I've had with an employee repressive I have ever had in my life.

It took over 2 HOURS to LEAVE the museum.\nVery disturbed that attendants still made people pay to leave as there were children crying, car alarms blaring, old people asking to use the bathroom and being told they a) can't go into the museum and b) can't leave the garage on-foot.

But there are lot of signs to not leave important/valuable items or viewable bags in your car.\n\nEntering was easy as leaving. It is a busy parking lot so you may need to make sure to save some time to find parking spots. We got extremely lucky and found a parking spot on the first floor. It is very tight, so if you're planning on driving a bigger SUV or Truck, expect it to be very difficult to maneuver through.\n\nTicket: keep your ticket with you. Do not leave it in the car. When you are leaving, pay at the pay station before leaving or you can pay at the gate. We paid before leaving and it was easy. Just insert the paid ticket and the gate opens.\n\nOverall, a solid parking spot for this location. There is an elevator that will lead you straight into the mall as well.",

              "text": "I've actually parked in this garage without issue many times before, but despite keeping my car clean and empty, a thief tried to break in and destroyed my quarter panel glass. This happened June 29, 2023, between 7-10pm at night (while I was seeing a show). I had parked near the second floor parking pay station, overlooking Van Ness.\n\nMy rating is not meant to be a reflection on the staff of the parking structure itself; they were actually really helpful and gave me what I needed to file an initial report of this incident. The location of this garage is also very worthwhile, for obvious reasons.\n\nJust remember that being in San Francisco is being in San Francisco, and paying $20 to park your car in a structure it doesn't necessarily guarantee its protection.",

It didn't feel sketchy inside, and on the weekends it feels busy (people coming and going). However we're aware of the \"don't leave anything inside policy\". We were concerned, so we left literally nothing inside, and we had no issues. Also we parked with the back (trunk) to the driving part of the parking garage to make it harder for anyone to hide while doing something. And we parked near a light. We found parking available the day we arrived (Thursday), but noticed a line of cars to enter on Saturday around lunch time, so beware availability during the weekend. Paying is simple enough, just pricey. We looked at many reviews of different parking garages to find the safest one and I believe they are all the same really, just don't leave anything at all (we also lowered our backseats to show the empty inside of the trunk). Apparently there's a similar structure on top of a police station a bit more north but we couldn't be bothered to go that far.",

DO NOT PARK HERE!!!!\n\nWe were going through San Francisco to get to our hotel in Oakland on the last day of our vacation. My children wanted to see China town so I figured I would park in a \"secured\" parking garage. WHAT A JOKE!\n\nWe walk around Chinatown for about an hour and a half just to come back to our van smashed to pieces! 4 windows broken out by thieves. Luckily enough we were smart enough to still take purses and wallets but they still got some of our luggage and worse of all they took all of my children's souvenirs and my wifes quilt blanket that she has had for 30+ years that she slept with every night!!!\n\nOnce I discovered our vehicle broken into I immediately ran around looking for someone to talk to because the police said \"fill out an online report\". I found an attendant on the 4th floor and he had the audacity to tell me we were asking for it because we left luggage in there!! WE PARKED IN A PAID SECURE PARKING GARAGE!\n\nWhen it was all said and done in my opinion the attendants are in on this. They see vehicles come in on the first floor near the exit with valuables and reach out to the other thieves. They come in the garage with a vehicle smash the windows and grab your stuff. This is not your typical smash and grab this is an organized operation. If you park here it's not a matter of if you will be broken into its a matter of when!\n\nUpdate: when we arrived home a very nice san francisco police officer reached out to me and had found some of our stuff laying in a pile on side of road. We are getting some souvenirs and other things back. WE WERE LUCKY!! If you park here you may not be so lucky. Hopefully you are smarter then me and read these reviews!!!!",

              "text": "I recently attended a conference in San Francisco and parked my car at the Ellis-O'Farrell Garage overnight. The garage is conveniently located within walking distance of many hotels and conference venues, and the daily maximum rate of $44 is reasonable.\nI was a little nervous at first because there is no on-site personnel, but I was happy to see that there was increased police patrol during the conference. I had no problems at all, and my car was safe and sound when I returned the next morning.\nIf you're looking for a convenient place to park your car overnight in San Francisco, I recommend the Ellis-O'Farrell Garage. Just be sure to exercise caution and leave no valuables in your car.",

It's right next door and has hundreds of spots.\n\nIt is the safest garage in the Tenderloin/ Union Square I've experienced, and hands down the cleanest garage I've seen in my life.\n\nAs of 9/1/2024, it's $44 per night ($35+tax). Pricey, but worth it for the convenience.\n\nGates lock sometime in the P.M., so you might not be able to get back in after 10pm or maybe even earlier.",

Make sure you remove everything on your car (like everything) and you should be good.\n\nI personally feel parking on a higher level and farthest from the elevator is safer as it can reduce the chances of getting your car broken into.",

It's about 5:00 am and I pulled into the garage and ended up downstairs (sub surface) There were no cars down the and it was looking pretty sketch. I drove up and I was being guided out. I WANTED TO SIMPKY ASK  IF THERE WAS A WAY TO GET UP to the upper floors bit the guys was so completely  rude, dismissive and even turned and walked away b4 I even asked the question. The facility would be better served  unmanned. The employee proved to be the worst interaction I've had with an employee repressive I have ever had in my life. So I ended up throwing away another 5.00 because this guy could not field a question and the manager dude didn't seem interested either, he certainly didn't offer any assistance ce either. Overall terrible experience ce, but that's the norm now..",

Pricing is reasonable, I am sure you can get cheaper rates elsewhere / in open air parking garages.\n\nSafety wise, 1) have not seen anyone unusual inside the parking garage, yes, it's one street away from 6th St and beyond so it's close but you don't see them within the structure; 2) Number plate will get scanned going in and out, and there are cameras in some strategic locations.\n\nWe are careful to pack away our valuables so car is left with nothing of value, all in all, no incidents (break-ins, catalytic converter getting stolen). Will consider parking here again in the future.",

The lot is packed full of cars, is well lit, and I saw security patrolling the area as well as a lot of fellow people moving about after having parked their car, or returning to it. I felt as safe as you can, being that it is San Francisco, that my car would be safe here. I returned about 10 hours later and my car was perfectly fine so I can't really complain. On the second floor near the elevators there was a massively smelly part that stank of pure urine but then again the whole city smells of urine and feces due to how poorly the city is run",
