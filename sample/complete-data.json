I work nearby so it’s convenient to park here, but TWO times we paid for 12 hours on the pay to park app that they provide because their machine wasn’t working and we still got TICKETS. The tickets were given out at around 11am, when we still had 10 hours left of parking time. Actually, all the cars around us also got tickets as well. We are now trying to contest the tickets but have to escalate the situation and might have to go to a hearing because SFMTA denied our request even while providing the receipt with the date and time on the app showing we paid. Unless you have time and want to risk getting a ticket, I suggest just finding a different garage or parking in the Marina Green (free parking).",

              "text": "I am extremely frustrated with my recent experience at the SF Parking North Beach garage. The lack of clarity in their parking ticket policy, combined with poor customer service, has left me feeling both angry and disappointed.\n\nThe signs clearly state that the ticket should be kept with you, but this policy should be changed to indicate that it should be left in the car. This setup seems designed to trick people into losing their tickets, forcing them to pay the full price without any prior warning or clear explanation.\n\nDuring peak parking hours on a weekday (around 3:30 PM), I had to quickly pull over to find a spot as I needed to use the bathroom before continuing my drive. I am not familiar with the area, and after parking, I realized I had misplaced my ticket. I called the number listed on the garage window, hoping for assistance, but the person who answered was incredibly rude. I apologized for the mistake, but before I could explain, the staff member abruptly interrupted me, shaming me for losing the ticket and stating that I would have to pay the full price.\n\nIf there is no staff on-site, it would make sense for them to have access to a system where they can verify entry times and charge the correct amount based on that. Unfortunately, the representative did not offer any assistance or show any interest in resolving the issue. It felt as though the garage company was more concerned with penalizing customers than providing service.\n\nI eventually located my ticket after retracing my steps to find a public bathroom. This could have been avoided if the garage had on-site staff or better customer support systems. Needless to say, I quickly paid the correct amount for my $4 parking and left the garage, determined not to return.\n\nOverall, I am extremely dissatisfied with the experience and would not recommend this garage to others. The lack of proper signage, combined with poor customer service, makes this facility a frustrating and unreliable option for parking in the area.",

It is a busy parking lot so you may need to make sure to save some time to find parking spots. We got extremely lucky and found a parking spot on the first floor. It is very tight, so if you're planning on driving a bigger SUV or Truck, expect it to be very difficult to maneuver through.\n\nTicket: keep your ticket with you. Do not leave it in the car. When you are leaving, pay at the pay station before leaving or you can pay at the gate. We paid before leaving and it was easy. Just insert the paid ticket and the gate opens.\n\nOverall, a solid parking spot for this location. There is an elevator that will lead you straight into the mall as well.",

This happened June 29, 2023, between 7-10pm at night (while I was seeing a show). I had parked near the second floor parking pay station, overlooking Van Ness.\n\nMy rating is not meant to be a reflection on the staff of the parking structure itself; they were actually really helpful and gave me what I needed to file an initial report of this incident. The location of this garage is also very worthwhile, for obvious reasons.\n\nJust remember that being in San Francisco is being in San Francisco, and paying $20 to park your car in a structure it doesn't necessarily guarantee its protection.",

It didn't feel sketchy inside, and on the weekends it feels busy (people coming and going). However we're aware of the \"don't leave anything inside policy\". We were concerned, so we left literally nothing inside, and we had no issues. Also we parked with the back (trunk) to the driving part of the parking garage to make it harder for anyone to hide while doing something. And we parked near a light. We found parking available the day we arrived (Thursday), but noticed a line of cars to enter on Saturday around lunch time, so beware availability during the weekend. Paying is simple enough, just pricey. We looked at many reviews of different parking garages to find the safest one and I believe they are all the same really, just don't leave anything at all (we also lowered our backseats to show the empty inside of the trunk). Apparently there's a similar structure on top of a police station a bit more north but we couldn't be bothered to go that far.",

              "text": "I believe I was overcharged at this parking garage. The sign near the Clay St. entrance clearly displayed a rate of $8, but I was charged $24. There was no staff on-site to verify the pricing or assist, and the listed phone number went straight to voicemail.\n\nWhile the garage had plenty of open spots on a weekday, it was poorly marked. There were no clear signs directing to the staircase or elevator for exiting the building.\n\nTwo of the staircases are closed due to construction which makes it really difficult to exit the building. It’s like a maze",

When we finished walking around the botanical gardens and headed back to the garage there was a solid line of cars filling the entire garage and two huge lines of people trying to pay their tickets at two 20th century vending machines.\nWe waited so long in line that it added an hour to our parking time.\nIt’s baffling to me that there are driverless cars roaming all around San Francisco and yet we are still waiting in line to make an electronic transaction from an ancient vending machine … and then waiting in another line to exit the garage because a person is collecting those tickets at the exit  - mind boggling.\nTrust me, take the time to circle the roads to find a spot above ground instead of waisting an hour below ground trying to get out of the garage. You’ll thank me.",

Then once you pay, you have to wait in line again in your car to get out (car line was all the way to the second floor). It took over 2 HOURS to LEAVE the museum.\nVery disturbed that attendants still made people pay to leave as there were children crying, car alarms blaring, old people asking to use the bathroom and being told they a) can't go into the museum and b) can't leave the garage on-foot. To top it all - there is absolutely no reception in the parking so there is no way to reach the parking / museum by phone to explain the situation and get help. GREEDY BUSINESS",

But there are lot of signs to not leave important/valuable items or viewable bags in your car.\n\nEntering was easy as leaving. It is a busy parking lot so you may need to make sure to save some time to find parking spots. We got extremely lucky and found a parking spot on the first floor. It is very tight, so if you're planning on driving a bigger SUV or Truck, expect it to be very difficult to maneuver through.\n\nTicket: keep your ticket with you. Do not leave it in the car. When you are leaving, pay at the pay station before leaving or you can pay at the gate. We paid before leaving and it was easy. Just insert the paid ticket and the gate opens.\n\nOverall, a solid parking spot for this location. There is an elevator that will lead you straight into the mall as well.",

The garage is conveniently located within walking distance of many hotels and conference venues, and the daily maximum rate of $44 is reasonable.\nI was a little nervous at first because there is no on-site personnel, but I was happy to see that there was increased police patrol during the conference. I had no problems at all, and my car was safe and sound when I returned the next morning.\nIf you're looking for a convenient place to park your car overnight in San Francisco, I recommend the Ellis-O'Farrell Garage. Just be sure to exercise caution and leave no valuables in your car.",

I WANTED TO SIMPKY ASK  IF THERE WAS A WAY TO GET UP to the upper floors bit the guys was so completely  rude, dismissive and even turned and walked away b4 I even asked the question. The facility would be better served  unmanned. The employee proved to be the worst interaction I've had with an employee repressive I have ever had in my life. So I ended up throwing away another 5.00 because this guy could not field a question and the manager dude didn't seem interested either, he certainly didn't offer any assistance ce either. Overall terrible experience ce, but that's the norm now..",

Pricing is reasonable, I am sure you can get cheaper rates elsewhere / in open air parking garages.\n\nSafety wise, 1) have not seen anyone unusual inside the parking garage, yes, it's one street away from 6th St and beyond so it's close but you don't see them within the structure; 2) Number plate will get scanned going in and out, and there are cameras in some strategic locations.\n\nWe are careful to pack away our valuables so car is left with nothing of value, all in all, no incidents (break-ins, catalytic converter getting stolen).
